# Mini GRC Compliance Program – NIST 800-53 (Cloud Environment)

## Purpose
This project demonstrates hands-on Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) work using **NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5** for a simulated organization.

The goal was to understand how security controls are identified, assessed, documented, and reported in a real-world cloud environment.

## Organization (Simulated)
- Company Name: NovaCloud AI Solutions
- Role Played: GRC / Compliance Analyst

## Environment Covered
- AWS Cloud Servers
- Employee Endpoints
- SaaS Applications (Microsoft 365, Jira)
- Customer Database

## Key Activities Performed
- Asset inventory creation
- NIST 800-53 control mapping
- Control status evaluation (Implemented / Partial / Planned)
- Control maturity assessment
- Gap identification and remediation planning
- Management-level compliance reporting

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel
- NIST SP 800-53 Documentation
  
# Sheet-by-Sheet Explanation – NIST 800-53 GRC Project
## Sheet 1: Asset Inventory
<img width="1333" height="224" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/832505f7-ac29-4ce9-be45-cba6ffe0fb81" />

### What This Sheet Is
This sheet lists all important assets owned by the organization.

### Why This Was Done
- Compliance starts by knowing what assets exist
- Controls cannot be applied without asset visibility
- Helps define compliance scope

### What I Did
- Identified key assets such as:
  - AWS Cloud Servers
  - Employee Laptops
  - SaaS tools (Microsoft 365, Jira)
  - Customer Database
- Assigned owners to each asset
- Rated criticality (High / Medium) based on business impact

### Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel
- Basic asset classification principles

## Sheet 2: Control Register

### What This Sheet Is
This is the core GRC working document where NIST 800-53 controls are evaluated.

### Why This Was Done
- To assess the organization’s security posture
- To understand which controls are implemented and which are missing
- To support risk and compliance decision-making

### What I Did
- Selected 15 relevant NIST 800-53 controls
- Covered major control families:
  - AC (Access Control)
  - IA (Identity & Authentication)
  - AU (Audit & Logging)
  - CM (Configuration Management)
  - CP (Contingency Planning)
  - IR (Incident Response)
  - RA (Risk Assessment)
  - PL (Policies)
- Explained each control in simple language
- Marked control status:
  - Implemented
  - Partially Implemented
  - Planned
- Assigned control owners (IT, Security, Compliance, HR)
- Rated control maturity from 1 (Initial) to 4 (Managed)
- Documented action items for improvement

### Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel
- NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5
- 
## Sheet 3: Compliance Summary

### What This Sheet Is
A high-level summary designed for managers and auditors.

### Why This Was Done
- Management does not read control-level details
- They want risk visibility and overall status

### What I Did
- Summarized asset coverage and control families
- Provided a snapshot of:
  - Total controls reviewed
  - Implemented vs planned controls
- Highlighted key gaps:
  - Incident Response
  - Logging & Monitoring
  - Risk Assessment
- Prepared metrics suitable for leadership reporting

### Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel
- GRC reporting best practices

## Overall Learning Outcome
- Understood how compliance assessments are structured
- Learned how to map assets to NIST controls
- Gained experience in control maturity assessment
- Practiced real-world GRC documentation and reporting

## Outcome
This project provides practical exposure to entry-level GRC responsibilities and compliance assessment workflows in a cloud-based environment.
